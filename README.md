**Pokemon Encyclopedia (using PokeAPI)**

By: Anton Clayton

<br />
- In this project, I am utilizing the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve information about pokemon that the user inputs.

<br />
<br />

**Features:**
- Displays the pokemon's sprite
- Has an autocomplete function for the input field to help the user find their desired pokemon based on input
- Displays the pokemon's type(s), ability, and hidden ability
- Has a button that plays the pokemon's cry
<br />
<br />

**Future Improvements:**
- More detailed stats and information for each pokemon (including information specific to each generation)
- Move the sprite and input field to the left to create more space for the autocomplete suggestions and make it seem more like the Pokedex in the pokemon games
- Move information and stats to the right so that there is more space
- Better styling overall
